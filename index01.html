        <p> You can find New Jersey on the east coast of the United States, between New York and Pennsylvania. Its location is remarkably accessible and indispensable. While millions call it home, many more millions visit, work, or pass through it each year. Connections to the Garden State include those with longstanding family ties to newcomers arriving to attend one of our renowned colleges or universities, work, or raise a family. In fact, wherever you are in the U.S., you’re likely to find someone with Jersey roots.</p>

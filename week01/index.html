    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="week01\images\profile.jpg" alt="My Photo" width="300">
    <p>Hello, my name is Dery Henriquez I am from Tegucigalpa, Honduras. I currently work as a diesel truck mechanic 
        in my own company, I really enjoy sharing my knowledge with others but especially with my children since knowledge 
        is the treasure that no one can take away from others. Thanks to this work I have been able to meet many people from 
        different parts of the world which is gratifying. I'm currently studying web and computer programming since I've always 
        had an interest in learning about programming and I really like it. </p>

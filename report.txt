CSE 111 – Student Chosen Program Report
---------------------------------------

Student Name: Dery Henriquez
Program Title: Bakery Inventory & Order Manager
Date: October 2025


1. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
-----------------------
This Python program helps a small bakery manage its daily operations by tracking inventory, customer orders, and ingredient usage.

The program:
- Loads bakery items and inventory from a CSV file.
- Allows the user to create a customer order.
- Calculates subtotals, tax, and total cost for the order.
- Updates the ingredient inventory automatically.
- Records each completed sale in a sales log file with a timestamp.
- Produces a formatted receipt for the customer.

The goal is to make order management easier, reduce inventory errors, and ensure pricing accuracy.


2. FUNCTIONS
-------------
The program is divided into multiple functions:

1. read_inventory(filename)  
   Reads bakery inventory data from a CSV file and returns it as a dictionary.

2. save_inventory(filename, inventory)  
   Writes updated inventory data back to a CSV file.

3. calculate_order_total(order_list, inventory, tax_rate) 
   Computes subtotal, tax, and total for the customer order.

4. update_inventory(order_list, inventory)  
   Deducts product quantities from inventory after the sale.

5. display_receipt(order_list, totals) 
   Returns a formatted receipt string showing order details.

6. record_order(order_list, totals)  
   Appends the order and totals with a timestamp to a CSV sales log.

7. get_user_order(inventory)  
   Displays available items and records the user’s selections.

8. main()  
   Coordinates program flow: load data, process orders, update inventory, save results.


3. PYTHON MODULES USED
-----------------------
- csv – to read and write inventory and sales log files.
- datetime – to record timestamps for each order.
- os – to check and manage file paths.
- pytest – for testing program functions.


4. TESTING
-----------
All test functions are in **test_bakery_manager.py**.

- test_calculate_order_total() 
   Tests subtotal, tax, and total calculations with two different orders.

- test_update_inventory()  
   Tests that the inventory quantities are reduced correctly after an order.

Both test functions contain at least two calls and two asserts each.  
All tests pass successfully.

Total time: 14 hours 


6. INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES
--------------------------
- inventory.csv – Stores bakery items and quantities.
- sales_log.csv – Records each completed order.
- bakery_manager.py – Main program file.
- test_bakery_manager.py – Test file with pytest functions.


7. PROGRAM RESULTS
-------------------
The program runs successfully and produces correct results:
- Inventory loads correctly from CSV.
- Orders calculate accurate totals and sales tax.
- Inventory updates automatically after sales.
- Receipts are formatted neatly.
- Sales are recorded with timestamps.


8. CONCLUSION
--------------
This project strengthened my understanding of file handling, dictionaries, modular design, and testing in Python.  
I also learned how to organize real-world data workflows for a business-type program.
